# Getting the API for Firebase

1. Go to Firebase and sign-in with the information in the Trello board
2. Go to Settings and scroll down to **Your apps**
3. The section is called "Download latest Config File"

The file is `GoogleService-info.plist` and needs to be dragged to be added to the Firebase folder

*The file will not show up on GitHub as it is being ignored to not publish the api key*
